# 🌟 Strong for 40 - Brand Identity & Defaults

## Brand Philosophy

**"Your brand from day one"**

Strong for 40 isn't just an app—it's a complete life operating system that feels intentional from the moment you sign up. No empty screens, no setup friction. You open the app and your standards are already there, waiting for you to build on.

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

### Traditional Apps
- Empty state on first launch
- User has to configure everything
- Feels generic and impersonal
- Takes time to feel "yours"

### Strong for 40
- **Instant setup** - 7 standards preloaded
- **Clear schedule** - Mon/Wed/Fri training
- **Opinionated defaults** - Based on what works
- **Feels intentional** from minute one

## ⭐ Default Standards (Preloaded)

Every new user gets these standards automatically:

### Daily Standards (6)
1. **Meditation** 🧘‍♂️ - "10 minutes of mindfulness"
2. **Coffee** ☕ - "Morning ritual"
3. **10-min walk** 🚶 - "Daily movement outside"
4. **Stretch** 🤸 - "Morning mobility routine"
5. **Water** 💧 - "Hydration check (8 glasses)"
6. **Kids dropoff done** 🚗 - "Morning routine complete"

### Weekly Standard (1)
7. **Workout** 💪 - "Strength training (Mon/Wed/Fri)" - 3x per week

## 🏋️ Training Schedule

**Suggested: Monday / Wednesday / Friday**

- A/B workout split
- 3 days per week
- Rest days in between
- Sustainable for busy professionals
- Built into the "Workout" standard tracking

## 📱 Branding Changes

### Visual
- **Habits** tab → **Standards** tab ⭐
- Tab icon changed from 🎯 to ⭐
- Header reads "Standards" instead of "Habits"
- Button: "+ New Standard" (not "+ New Habit")

### Language
- "Standard" instead of "habit"
- "Maintaining your standards" (not "tracking habits")
- "Check-in to your standards"
- "Build consistency" (not just "track")

### User Experience
- No empty state on first use
- Standards already populated
- Week view shows completion progress
- Streaks build automatically

## 🎨 Why "Standards" vs "Habits"

**Habits** suggests:
- Something you're trying to build
- New behavior you're forming
- Optional or experimental

**Standards** suggests:
- Non-negotiable baseline
- Identity ("This is who I am")
- Professional expectation
- Consistent quality

**Strong for 40** is about maintaining high standards as you approach a milestone age. These aren't just habits—they're your baseline for showing up as your best self.

## ✨ Brand Principles

1. **Opinionated** - We have a point of view
2. **Instant value** - No empty states
3. **Identity-based** - This is who you are, not what you do
4. **Sustainable** - Mon/Wed/Fri, not every day
5. **Professional** - Standards, not habits
6. **Intentional** - Every default has a reason

## 🎁 What Users Get Day One

3. **Creates identity** - "I maintain standards"
4. **Sustainable habits** - Not overwhelming
5. **Professional feel** - Elevated language
6. **Clear schedule** - Mon/Wed/Fri removes guesswork
